This plugin will help you update your feature ID sequentially. It will work only for line features. 
As a GIS analyst, I had to make it to make my task easier at SMEC. I had to update thousands of line features's id sequentially. 
If I do this same task manually, it will take hours. But it helps me update within a few minutes. When I work with this plugin, it works like a snake if I use the filter section. You could understand by watching the video. For that reason, I gave it's name GIS Snake tool.ðŸ˜Š
